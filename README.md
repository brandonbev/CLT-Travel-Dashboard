# CLT-Travel-Dashboard


I have a passion for travel and have found that flying on Wednesday's allows me to find the best deal, avoid airports during peak hours, and spend a long weekend in a new place.
This dashboard was created to help me find flights departing from Charlotte, NC (CLT) on Wednesday's with economy seats available the day of for a spontaneous trip.  

Data source uses Wednesday 2/23 as an example extracted from OAG.com
